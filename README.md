Usage Notes
-----------

This plugin can be configured to read all the contenets for multiple files in a directory and bulk load into vertica table. This plugin provides option to commit after every file written to vertica table. 

If Basic level of Copy statement is selected, table name and delimiter should be provided. With Advanced option selected, table name and delimiter fileds will not have any effect.

This plugin also emits metrics "num.of.rows.rejected"" for number of rows successfully created and "num.of.rows.inserted" number of rows rejected.
